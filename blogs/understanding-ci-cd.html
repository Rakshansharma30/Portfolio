        <h1>Understanding CI/CD Pipelines</h1>
        <p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a practice that automates software delivery by ensuring that code changes are built, tested, and deployed with minimal manual intervention.</p>

        <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Introduction to CI/CD</h2>
        <p>CI/CD is essential for modern software development, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software faster by automating the software release process.</p>

        <h2>üéØ Why Use CI/CD?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faster Delivery:</strong> Automates the deployment process.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Reduction:</strong> Reduces human errors in production.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Feedback:</strong> Provides real-time insights into system health.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Enables teams to manage larger codebases effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üîó Core CI/CD Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI):</strong> Merges code frequently to avoid integration issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Deployment (CD):</strong> Deploys new code changes to production automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Delivery:</strong> Prepares code for deployment but requires manual approval for production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üß© CI/CD Pipeline Stages</h2>
        <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Source Stage</h3>
        <p>Triggered when new code is pushed to the repository. Version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) track changes.</p>

        <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Build Stage</h3>
        <p>Compiles the code and creates executable artifacts. Builds Docker images or packages.</p>

        <h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Test Stage</h3>
        <p>Runs unit, integration, and functional tests to ensure that the application meets quality standards.</p>

        <h3>4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Stage</h3>
        <p>Deploys the application to the target environment, which can be done using Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or cloud services.</p>

        <h2>‚ö° Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` File</h3>
        <pre><code>
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run Tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/

    - name: Build Docker Image
      run: |
        docker build -t myapp .

    - name: Deploy to Server
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
        </code></pre>

        <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices for CI/CD Pipelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>‚úÖ Automate unit and integration tests to catch bugs early.</li>
            <li>‚úÖ Use feature flags to control feature rollouts.</li>
            <li>‚úÖ Monitor pipeline performance and optimize for efficiency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üì¢ Conclusion</h2>
        <p>CI/CD pipelines automate the software delivery process, allowing teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently.</p>
